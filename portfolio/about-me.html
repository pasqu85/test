           <b id="greeting"></b> everyone, <br>my name is Pasquale and I am a web developer. <br>
           My passion for this job comes from the moment I have decided to open my blog dedicated to technology, in particular, smartphones. <br>
           This blog started out as a game for me but after a while it becomes a hobby. And finally, it is my passion. <br>
           I then approached the web with zero knowledge, and today, after several courses I find myself a website building expert, and I still spend a lot of time studying to improve my skills as a web developer more and more. <br>
           Why a web designer? In fact, I am already the owner degree of graphic designer, so I can create logos, posters and much more related to the world of advertising. <br>
           However, I realized that even internet sites have their own graphic structure, which I can modify as I wish, with the possibility, however, of giving animations and a longer life. Yes, because a website evolves, it cannot and must not be the same over the years, and I'm here to make sure it doesn't happen to you either. My motto is simplicity and minimalism, with a little touch of depth to the pages. <br>
           I position myself in the Material Design range mainly, but I can move in all categories without any problem. In the portfolio you will find some examples, while if you are curious to look at my blog, I leave you the link. I start by telling you that being a blog, it is built on a Wordpress basis. But the whole structure, including the logo, was created by me.<br>
           I believe it is one of the most beautiful blog around.<br>
           Please have look and let me know.
